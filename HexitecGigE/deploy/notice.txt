The HEXITEC Gig E software is designed to control and readout the data from the HEXITEC detector. The software will collect, process and display the hyperspectral data collected from HEXITEC.

This work was designed and funded by the Science & Technology Facilities Council, UK and builds upon the work conducted throughout the HEXITEC collaboration through the EPSRC funded grants (EP/D048737/1 and EP/H046577/1).
