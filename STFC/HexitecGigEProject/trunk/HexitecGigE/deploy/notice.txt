2Easy is designed for the purpose of exploring and manipulating hyperspectral image data. The software is part of an ongoing collaboration and its development is currently supported by University of Manchester (UoM) under the EPSRC project entitled HEXITEC: Translation Grant. The Application of Colour X-ray Imaging (EP/H046577/1); the project is led by Professor Cernik (UoM).

Karen Ackroyd and Steve Kinder of DSoFt Solutions have made significant contributions to the development of this code.  Other contributors include Chris Egan (UoM). The code makes use of some 3rd part software including the charge-discrimination program Hexitec by Tim Nicholls of STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. This is an under-development version (2.2.030412) and is not for distribution. For futher information about this project please use the contact below.
